<h1>Crowdfire assignment repo</h1>

Steps to get it up and running

- Install node, npm/yarn.
- Clone this repo and run ```cd cf-assignment```

Assumptions: 
- Used a random static server to host images and all data is store in local storage.
- You can upload images from ```IMAGE GALLERY``` option in header as well as when you are creating attire for a day in the calendar view. 
- Haven't maintained a seperate pant and shirt image. If user is girl, she should be able to upload a dress/saree as well.
